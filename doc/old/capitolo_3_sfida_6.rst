Challenge 6: Accompanying the transformation
--------------------------------------------

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is both a technological and social
innovation, since it brings with it all the benefits and complexities
that can radically transform society, including the public sector. An
innovation, therefore, that can contribute to improving the quality of
the services offered and to reinforcing the relationship of trust
between administration and citizen.

The opportunities offered by the AI concern both the increase in
efficiency of administration operations and user satisfaction. To
exploit them to the fullest and to ensure that citizens fully understand
their advantages and potential, it is also necessary to deal with issues
concerning governance, the use of new technologies and the ability to
manage data.

Furthermore, the transformation process we are witnessing involves the
creation of a culture within Public Administration that includes
capacity building activities, both with respect to the presence of a
leadership that promotes the use of artificial intelligence, as well as
the capacity of public officials to implement them.

Within the scope of public services, AI can be used to optimise the
internal resources of PA to increase the use of online services,
supporting, for example, a series of activities such as:

    ● completing complex tasks;

    ● dispatching citizens’ requests and answering their questions;

    ● effectively managing large amounts of data;

    ● combining information from different datasets;

    ● providing faster answers based on predictive scenarios;

    ● automating repetitive processes;

    ● analysing data that includes text/audio and video
    information [1]_.

Finally, the integration of AI can contribute to increasing the capacity
of public employees, as a tool to support decision making and without
ever replacing human judgment. The immediately perceptible benefit,
together with the possibility of having systems that learn to accompany
decisions in an accurate and personalised way, is the possibility of
saving time for employees who can dedicate themselves to more
specialised activities or that require greater creativity and empathy.
In this way, services become more efficient, relations with citizens are
improved and the level of trust in institutions is increased.

The introduction of AI in people’s lives requires the design of
processes that facilitate the acceptance of technologies by the user,
not only through the use of experimentation but also through
collaboration mechanisms that allow citizens to participate in the
design of AI platforms. Thanks to the co-creation approach, as happens
in design thinking, users perceive technology as their own and show a
greater propensity to use it. Moreover, where issues or problems in its
use are found, citizens show a greater propensity to actively
participate in their solution [2]_.

In facilitating the vicinity and engagement of citizens towards new
AI-based public services, design itself plays a key role. In fact, it
represents the meeting point between technology and people. Designers
will have to design interfaces that do not just mimic human actions,
since this mechanism can generate alienation, but that are able to
establish a relationship of trust with citizens, using a language that
is understandable and that puts them at ease [3]_.

The challenge will be to build flexible systems able to provide answers
that adapt to the user’s contingent needs, thus ensuring better and more
efficient services. A peculiar characteristic of AI is indeed that of
correlating continuously evolving data coming from multiple sources and
extracting dynamic response models from it. Another area on which the
designers will have to focus will be the design of AI systems able to
anticipate the needs of citizens without having an invasive approach
that could compromise the user experience.

Another crucial element for introducing AI in a structured manner in the
administration concerns the ability to manage data and to exploit the
great wealth of information that PA possesses, facilitating not only
interoperability, but also transparency and reliability.

In the light of this, it is desirable that the application of AI
technologies to public administration aims at adopting shared ontologies
in line with the internal organisation of PA and with the types of
services to be provided, developing controlled vocabularies able to
interpret and interoperate the databases of national interest to the
fullest. [4]_

In this regard, knowledge representation and self-learning systems can
be a valuable aid in increasing the accountability of the models. The
adoption of collaborative methods can further ensure that the models
adopted are compatible with PA and remain consistent with the regulatory
framework.

In addition to the potential described above, certain issues in the
adoption of AI in the public sector can be identified: in general, AI
systems can be implemented successfully only if high data quality is
guaranteed.

In terms of governance, the transformation process we are witnessing
also involves the evolution of relations between public and private
players. Benefiting from AI in public services does not necessarily mean
developing new solutions from scratch. On the contrary, it is possible
to look at what has already been adopted by other governments, or draw
on technologies already established on the market.

Another area of collaboration between the public and private sectors is
that of procurement. In this sense, AgID, for example, has recently
started initiated comparison and experimentation of new scenarios for
the dissemination of PCP (pre-commercial procurement).

|                                                                       |
| **Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP)** is an innovative purchasing      |
| formula on Research and Development issues, which enables procurement |
| for new methods of relationship and discussion with the market, in    |
| line with the great challenges posed by a modern Public               |
| Administration [5]_. The program deals with issues of significant     |
| social impact and public innovation: from autism to protection from   |
| environmental risks, to food safety and quality, as well as           |
| innovative technological solutions applied to healthcare and          |
| e-government. Not only large companies but also start-ups, small      |
| businesses and venture capitalists have the opportunity to present    |
| innovative ideas and proposals.                                       |
|                                                                       |
| PCP is therefore a fertile ground for experimentation and research    |
| aimed at meeting social needs, also with innovative tools related to  |
| AI. An example in this sense is the “Technologies for Autism” tender  |
| aimed at identifying Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality            |
| technologies typified for people with an autistic spectrum condition  |
| (ASC) [6]_.                                                           |
