Challenge 7: Preventing inequalities
------------------------------------

The objective of this challenge is to pay further attention on the ways
in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies can trigger positive
effects in terms of reducing the existing socio/economic/cultural
differences.

There are several areas in which the integration of AI solutions would
reduce social inequalities. These include:

-  education and training;

-  knowledge and guarantee of individual rights;

-  health and disability, intended as support for situations of
   hardship.

A significant intervention of intelligent learning support systems is
conceivable in the school sector. There is a long tradition of using the
computer for these purposes: such as *Computer Assisted Instruction*
(CAI) systems and *Intelligent Tutoring Systems* (ITS). In ITS there is
always a *student model*\  [1]_, understood as a knowledge base in which
the student’s characteristics and knowledge are explicitly represented.
This solution plays a supporting role as it provides an integration to
traditional teaching systems, helping to fill learning gaps of students
with cognitive problems.

Another point of intervention in the school sector is the reduction of
the linguistic gap. The offer of adequately modelled simultaneous
translation services could help to close the gap generated by new waves
of migration, thus offering valuable assistance to study [2]_.
Artificial Intelligence technologies could also play a decisive role in
the battle against functional illiteracy [3]_.

Furthermore, the AI ​​could be applied to overcome the limits imposed by
the need to have specialist knowledge to carry out certain activities.
IA systems could spread access to information, knowledge of rights and
could facilitate the methods for exercising them by those who are in
difficult living conditions and that do not have certain knowledge, thus
contributing to reducing discrimination. This represents a very
important area of ​​work that requires appropriate awareness raising and
cultural promotion.

As for the disability sector, some interesting solutions are pointed out
as they can guarantee easier, and more usable, access to services, thus
improving the quality of life of individuals. For example this is the
case of integrated speech synthesizers for visually impaired persons,
which could be implemented with automatic editing programs that can
remember previous communications and provide drafts of text, or some
experiments involving people suffering from degenerative diseases, like
ALS, which provide communication systems which can complete and
facilitate the communication process.

If we want to consider the types of IA solutions already known, the use
of digital assistants could transversally close the gaps in different
categories: for example, thanks to AI problems such as dyslexia could
find a monitoring and a correction attempt through the use of digital
assistants which can perform the function of the speech therapist or
psychologist.

The challenge of inequalities should also be tackled from the
perspective of the need to prevent increasing existing inequalities.
There are two levels of potential discrimination, one involving access
to and use of AI technologies and one induced by the same AI systems,
based on race, gender and other social factors.

It is necessary to operate in order to ensure access to AI tools and
solutions as well as to ensure awareness of their use, in order to avoid
that only certain categories can benefit from these technologies. In
this case, we must avoid thinking that the AI ​​is in itself a value,
especially if its use is not accompanied by appropriate interventions
aimed at reducing the possibility of creating further gaps. It should
also be avoided that the AI technologies themselves lead to
inequalities.

A PA linked to the paradigm of social responsibility should not create
situations in which the most advanced contact methods, which are also
the simplest and which guarantee greater accessibility of services, are
the exclusive preserve of those who, by culture, propensity, social
extraction or technological endowment are more predisposed to such
uses [4]_.

It is necessary that the administration takes great care in acquiring or
addressing the development of AI solutions in order to ensure that:

-  they are inclusive, accessible, transparent and comply with legal
   requirements;

-  they do not have discriminatory profiles;

-  they are free from *bias*.

In recent times, one of the most active research areas in the field of
AI has been the study of *bias* both from a more formal statistical
point of view and from a broader legal and regulatory profile. In a
positive scenario, AI systems can be used to “increase”, improve human
judgement and reduce our conscious or unconscious biases. However, data,
algorithms and other design choices that can influence AI systems, can
reflect and amplify the cultural assumptions existing at a given
historical moment and, consequently, inequalities.

Therefore *biases* become the basis for making decisions, favouring some
scenarios instead of others, creating disparities and non-homogeneous
distribution of opportunities [5]_.

To do this, it is necessary to expand the bias search and mitigation
strategies, not limiting them to a strictly technical approach. Biases,
by their nature, constitute structural and long-term distortions that
require a deep interdisciplinary research in order to be faced.

Addressing and solving critical issues linked to *bias* therefore
necessarily requires an interdisciplinary collaboration and transversal
listening methods to different disciplines [6]_.

This is where the most important game for the prevention of inequalities
is played. This is the context in which the Public Administration has
the task of intervening, addressing the development of AI solutions,
aware of the enormous potential that these have in the promotion of a
more widespread equity and in reducing the gaps existing in our
community.

   The use of artificial intelligence at the service of machine
   translations is now widespread (for example the cases of Google,
   DeepL - *See*

   these have been joined, in more recent times, by instant translation
   systems and subsequent speech synthesis of messages in a desired
   language (an example is the system currently under development by
   BabelOn Technologies - *See*
   `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdZsvLNuko <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdZsvLNuko>`__,
   or the Google headset that allows to instantly translate every
   conversation) that open interesting perspectives of use in the school
   sector.

   According to art. 8 of the Digital Administration Code (Legislative
   Decree No. 82/2005), the State and the public administrations
   “\ *promote initiatives aimed at encouraging the diffusion of digital
   culture among citizens with particular regard to minors and
   categories at risk of exclusion, also in order to encourage the
   development of legal information technology skills and the use of
   digital services of public administrations with specific and concrete
   actions*\ ”.

   Episodes of this kind have occurred in many cases: in rating
   algorithms, in the assignment of gig economy jobs and, in general, in
   algorithmically mediated work.
