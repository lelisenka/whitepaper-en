Guide to consultation 
======================

**What the White Paper is not and what it is not meant to be:**

1. **It is not the final document.**

2. **It is neither a scientific paper, nor a document meant to give a
   360° view of AI implications.**

3. **It does not intend to be a policy document.**

**What the White Paper is and what it will become:**

1. **It is a work in progress:** we published a first draft that
   delineates the framework within which people is invited to express
   their ideas bearing in mind the scope of the white paper. The final
   document, complemented with thematic supplementary worksheets, will
   be published at the end of the presentation.

2. **It is a document that aims at deepening a specific field of
   application of AI**: how Artificial Intelligence tools can facilitate
   the relationship between citizens and Public administration. The
   white paper proposes a streamlined approach to convey information to
   the general public.

3. **The final document will also include a section devoted to
   recommendations for the public sector**: suggestions to tackle the
   challenges addressed in the white paper that can be submitted during
   the consultation period according to the following instructions.

**Public consultation guidance**

The white paper is for consultation until **March 12th 2018**.

**How to submit your contributions**

You can contribute to this consultation by inserting your comments in
the section “Show comments” at the end of each chapter and of each
challenge of the white paper.

If you want to submit recommendations, please fill in the form

**Outcome of the public consultation**

The Artificial Intelligence Task Force will discuss the results of the
online public consultation and possibly insert contributions in the
final version of the white paper.

**Target group**

All citizens and organisations are welcomed to participate in this
consultation: public administrations, research centres, experts,
entities that study or work in the field of AI and, in general, anyone
who wants to contribute to the white paper.

*The Association AI*IA sent its contribution that will be integrated in
the white paper during the consultation period*.
